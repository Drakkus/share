WoonRO Public Release
=====================
Hello everyone. WoonRO has been in the RO community for many years, we have had the opportunity to work with some mazing developers and amazing people in general. Back when eAthena was around and active, the community was very different than what it is today. It is my impression that the community has become far more selfish. This is partly due to individual behavior but also due to the mentality of the core developers of both rAthena and Hercules. It has come to my attention that many server owners are desperate for more up to date Renewal content. Through this year my staff and I have translated and cleaned up the semi-officail instances provided here: http://herc.ws/board/topic/11649-semi-official-instances-package-v03/

We have spent months gathering the most accurate monster, item and quest information. A lot of time and effort was put into each and every instance here. A copy of the instances has been provided to one of the devs at Hercules. However they wish to apply HULD and other stuff to it so official releases will not be happening for a long time. 

As we are incredibly busy getting the new server ready for launch I do not have time to compile all of the information, I just want to give a heads up to server admins that this is coming. Just have a bit more patience. Got Hercules users, I am trying to convert the source edits you will need into plugins to make your life easier. 

It is time to start sharing again. Feel free to make requests and send scripts here as well once we get things rolling. You will be given credit for your efforts. Once the releases are made for those of you on rAthena, I would appreciate if you would send back the converted scripts so I can provide those as well.
